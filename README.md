#A Hacker's Guide to NYC

Here's the inspiration for this project: http://islandofatlas.net/2013/10/04/a-hackers-guide-to-the-bay-area.html#hist-geo

Instead of writing about the bay area, I'm going to write about the NYC tech scene. The difference: am going to incorporate the Google Maps API and (possibly) the Meetup API too.

##TODO
- ~~when a marker is clicked on, html div opens DONE (right now I fill in the div with an image positioned on top of the map)~~
- ~~make the markers different colors DONE~~
- ~~figure out what places I want to map out (hackathons, co-working spaces, where to find info, food, meetups, classes, rent, grocery shopping)~~ (basic table of contents is pretty much done)~~
- ~~find all the coordinates for each of the locations (ongoing)~~
- figure out how to apply qunit testing
- ~~incorporate meetup.com API (simplest: draw in events; complex: get it to populate the map)~~
- when an outside link is clicked on, map does something (i.e. zooms into that specific location)
- ~~give background image to home page DONE~~
- put select boxes on the marker legend and figure out how to filter relevant markers on the map
- ~~write up short descriptions for each topic in the outline~~
