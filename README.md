A hacker's guide to NYC

//TODO
- when a marker is clicked on, html div opens
- //different colored markers?
- figure out what places I want to map out (hackathons, co-working spaces, where to find info, food, meetups, classes, rent, grocery shopping INSPIRATION: http://islandofatlas.net/2013/10/04/a-hackers-guide-to-the-bay-area.html#hist-geo )
- find all the coordinates for each of the locations
- figure out how to apply qunit testing
- update "what i've learned" document on evernote and share (?)
- figure out problem(s) from class exercise
- figure out Aidan's Tile example from class, sigh. Or rather, the var that = this; trick. Maybe ask on stackoverflow instead?


ASK ON SO:
- closure/recursive function w/ markers
- i'm still missing something about "this" and scoping. :(
