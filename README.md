#A Hacker's guide to NYC

INSPIRATION: http://islandofatlas.net/2013/10/04/a-hackers-guide-to-the-bay-area.html#hist-geo (except mine is going to feature interactive google maps and maybe use the meetup API as well)

##TODO
- ~~when a marker is clicked on, html div opens DONE (right now I fill in the div with an image positioned on top of the map) ~~
- ~~different colored markers? DONE~~
- ~~figure out what places I want to map out (hackathons, co-working spaces, where to find info, food, meetups, classes, rent, grocery shopping)~~ (basic table of contents is pretty much done)
- find all the coordinates for each of the locations (ongoing)
- figure out how to apply qunit testing
- incorporate meetup.com API (simplest: draw in events; complex: get it to populate the map)
- when an outside link is clicked on, map does something (i.e. zooms into that specific location)
- ~~give background image to home page DONE~~
- put select boxes on the marker legend and figure out how to filter relevant markers on the map
