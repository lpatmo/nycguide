I write from the perspective of a 20-something front-end web developer who enjoys collaborating at hackathons, <a href="http://www.thecodingdiaries.com" target="_blank">blogs about learning how to code</a>, and enjoys <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lpnotes" target="_blank">recording music</a> and the occasional bagel.

                <p>I started frequenting tech meetups -- mostly via <a href="http://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">meetup.com</a> -- in 2013. I had just transitioned into a full-time front-end web development role at a progressive non-profit, had gone to my first hackathon in November 2012, and was thirsting to meet other developers.</p>
                <p> To be honest, I think much of my enthusiasm for tech meetups stemmed from the fact that I worked at a completely distributed office -- which meant that everyone worked from home. I loved interacting with my co-workers online, but to be able to talk shop about what technologies people were using or learning, and to share about victories and struggles, was a breath of fresh air away from the lonely intensity of the computer screen. </p>
                <p>Silicon "Alley" can't quite compete with Silicon Valley for the tech mecca trophy, but it is growing -- and the tech industry is fast becoming NYC's <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4784088/bloomberg-tech-summit-study-says-new-york-city-tech-is-booming" target="_blank"> second largest sector</a>. The city is big enough that there are often multiple meetups or hackathons going on at once, but small enough that I've met acquaintances that have become friends.
                </p>
                <p>More than 1000 tech and digital companies proudly show off their "Made in NY" labels; you can check out the full list of NYC-based tech companies <a href="http://wearemadeinny.com/made-in-ny-list/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

                  <h3 id="hackathons">Hackathons</h3>
                  <p>Hackathons happen quite frequently during fair weather (at least every other weekend, it seems), and are great places for meeting other people in the tech scene. You do NOT need to be an expert programmer, already have a team, or already have an idea about what you want to build when you show up. TechCrunch hosts a hackathon in NYC once a year, Angelhack shows up a few times a year, an extremely laid-back <a href="http://monthlymusichackathon.org/" target="_blank">Music Hackathon</a> takes place approximately every month, and NYC headlined NASA's SpaceApps Challenge hackathon in 2014.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   <a href="http://www.garysguide.com/events" target="_blank">Gary's Guide</a> and <a href="http://www.alleynyc.com/" target="_blank">Alley NYC</a> are both great weekly mailing lists to be on if you want the latest news about upcoming hackathons in the city.    </p>
                  <h3 id="hackerhours">Sundays at AlleyNYC: Hacker Hours, Code Crew, and Python Meetups</h3>
                  <p>Here's a little secret: come to Alley NYC between 12pm-4pm on Sundays (when there isn't a hackathon taking place), and prepare to co-work with friendly Hacker Hours, Code Crew, or Python meetup members. Think of the experience as a cross between a study hall and a "productive" networking party. Bring your laptop, say hello, feel free to ask for help if you're stuck on a specific coding issue, and help others if you can.

                   <h3 id="specific">Other Meetups</h3>
                     <p>Just to give you a sense of the other types of meetups that happen in NYC:
                     <ul>
                     <li> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPressNYC/" target="_blank">The Wordpress meetup</a> hosts a speaker event for $6 (pizza and water bottle included!) every third Tuesday at Alley NYC, and has featured Buddypress developers to Automattic employees. </li>
                     <li> Ruby on Rails is very popular. Check out some of their meetups <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                     <li> The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/" target="_blank">New York Python Meetup</a> is also very active, and has weekly informal study groups/office hours on Saturdays and Sundays as well as speaker events throughout the week. A <a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-nyc/" target="_blank">Django group</a> typically meets on Thursdays.</li> 
                     <li>For those interested in a more structured learning environment, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYPluralsightStudy/" target="_blank">Pluralsight meetup</a> features weekly video sessions on anything from git to node.js. Spaces at Pluralsight run out pretty quickly, though -- so make sure you RSVP early.</li>
                     <li>Meet other developers interested in social good at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Developers-for-Good/" target="_blank">Developers for Social Good</a> meetup.</li>
                     </ul> </p>
                     <h3 id="women">Women-oriented Meetups</h3>
                        <p>Some of my favorites:
                        <ul>
                        <li> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code/" target="_blank">Ladies Who Code</a> - Come for the pizza and cupcakes; stay for the hacking and the conversations. </li>
                        <li> <a href="http://www.writespeakcode.com/" target="_blank">Write Speak Code</a> - Professional development conference for women developers.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-PyLadies/" target="_blank">Pyladies</a> - Great lightning talks, speaker presentations, and hacker hours</li>
                        </ul></p>

                      <div class="panel-heading" id="header-upcoming">Rent, Food, and Transportation</div>

                             <p>Yes, finding a good apartment in NYC can be tough. In my experience, Craigslist can be helpful, but roommate searching via your network of friends (or anyone you might be acquainted with) is even more helpful. Some people swallow the fees and use brokers to some success.
                              <h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>
                              <p>Unless you live more than 15 minutes walking distance from a subway station, trust me -- you won't need a car! The subways can be confusing during the weekend when the local tracks run express or when parts of the subways are shut down, but in general you'll be able to make your destination with a couple of transfers along the way. If you get lost during your first few weeks here, don't be afraid to ask a stranger for directions. The buses in the city are also a convenient way to get around. You can ride on them for the same price as a subway ride. Most people who live in NYC buy monthly subway passes, which allows them to take a subway or a bus as many times as they want.</p>
